# Purpose
This App is created to practice Reactjs as well as serving me with news posts from the Guardian.

# How to use
I have already set all the scripts in package.json. You don't need to run any other commands in your terminal such as `webpack` or `webpack-dev-server`, etc. All the commands are listed blow.

`npm install`, install all the dependencies and dev-dependencies for this project.
`npm run start`, run webpack-dev-server, type http://localhost:8080 to open this project in your browser, and you can change the code in this project if you want to develop this app for your own.
`npm run build`, run webpack, webpack will bundle all the modules into a single js file, and you can enter into GApp folder and double click index.html to use this app.
Besides, you have to change the apikey in this app into your own apikey
